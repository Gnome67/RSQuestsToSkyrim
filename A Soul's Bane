Notes:

Rage - 
Sword = only harms unicorns
Spear = only harms bears
Mace = only harms rats
Battleaxe = only harms goblins

Fear - 
Search 5 holes to progress; Fight a reaper each time. Can't search same hole twice.

Confusion - 
10 doors, 10 enemies. Each enemy is linked to a door. 9 of the enemies are fake and will disappear if you hit them eight times. You must kill the real one 9 times to remove one of the fake doors, until only the real one remains.
